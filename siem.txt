SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) are both crucial components in the realm of cybersecurity, but they have different focuses and capabilities.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
Definition: SIEM is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity from many different resources across your IT infrastructure. It collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and more.

Primary Function: Its main function is to provide real-time visibility into an organizationâ€™s information security by monitoring, detecting, and alerting on security events.

Data Aggregation: SIEM systems are designed to gather, store, and analyze log data and other data from various sources within an IT environment.

Compliance and Reporting: SIEM is particularly strong in compliance management and reporting. It can generate reports for compliance purposes, helping organizations meet various regulatory requirements.

Rule-Based: SIEM typically works on a rule-based approach for threat detection, relying on a set of predefined rules and correlations to identify potential security incidents.

Historical Analysis: It is also used for historical analysis and forensics, allowing organizations to investigate past security incidents.
