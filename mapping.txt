Steps for Field Mapping in McAfee ESM
Identify Source Data Fields

Begin by identifying the data fields provided by your log sources (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, applications). This includes fields like source IP, destination IP, timestamp, event type, etc.
Understand McAfee ESM Fields

Familiarize yourself with the default fields within McAfee ESM. These are the fields into which you’ll map your source data.
Mapping Process

For each log source, map its data fields to the corresponding fields in McAfee ESM. This might involve renaming fields or transforming data formats to align with ESM expectations.
Custom Fields (if needed)

If your log source contains data that doesn’t fit into existing ESM fields, you may need to create custom fields within ESM to accommodate this data.
Testing and Validation

After mapping, it's crucial to test and validate that the data is being correctly parsed and represented in ESM. This might involve reviewing parsed logs and verifying alert triggers.
Adjustment and Optimization

Based on your observations during testing, you might need to adjust mappings for accuracy and efficiency.
