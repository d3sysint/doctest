XDR (Extended Detection and Response)
Definition: XDR is an integrated suite of security products spanning hybrid IT architectures, designed to interoperate and coordinate on threat prevention, detection, and response.

Broader Scope: XDR extends beyond traditional endpoints to cover a wider range of security telemetry from networks, cloud environments, and applications.

Integrated Approach: Unlike SIEM, which integrates data from various sources, XDR integrates the security products themselves, providing a more unified and coordinated security response.

Advanced Threat Detection: XDR uses more advanced techniques like behavioral analysis and machine learning to detect and respond to threats, often in real time.

Automated Response: XDR systems not only detect threats but also automate responses to these threats, reducing the time and effort required for manual intervention.

Proactive Security Posture: XDR is designed to be more proactive in identifying and responding to advanced threats, potentially before they cause significant damage.
